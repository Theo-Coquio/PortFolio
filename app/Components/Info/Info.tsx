          It all started at school, where I learned the basics of programming,
          starting with HTML and CSS! It all started there, and I loved it
          instantly. Unfortunately, that course didn&apos;t last and programming
          fell into darkness in favour of the rest of my school year. But one

          Since then, web development has become an obvious choice for me
