        <p>
          At school, I discovered the basics or programing, with langages like
          HTML and CSS, and I loved it straight away. But the courses
          didn&apos;t last, until one day, by chance, a YouTube video rekindled
          my passion. Since then, web development has become an obvious choice
          for me: it&apos;s what I want to do!
