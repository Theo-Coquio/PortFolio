      starting with HTML and CSS! It all started there, and I loved it
      instantly. Unfortunately, that course didnâ€™t last and programming fell
      into darkness in favour of the rest of my school year. But one day, by
      chance, YouTube gave me the most wonderful recommendation. Since then,
      web development has become an obvious choice for me.`,
